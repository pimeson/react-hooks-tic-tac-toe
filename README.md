# Playing with React Hooks

As the title suggests, just exploring 16.8 `React Hooks`. I like how they get rid of a lot of boiler plate, and the elimination of classes.
I don't like how they make me feel like a dinosaur.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
